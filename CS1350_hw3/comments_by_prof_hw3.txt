Great job, and keep up the good work, Amari!

Details:
Line 35-40: Nice checking against single and empty names
Line 90: r'\b\d+\b' is sufficient, you are already checking against the word
         boundary
Line 92: This will only match words with exactly one digit
Line 164: No need for strip
Line 191-198: No need to be this complicated--parts[i+1] will be the separator, 
              and upper() returns the sample
Line 233: Great using flags.
